## ✨ Introduction
HeartNet is an application that uses sensors on your smartwatch to predict cardiac arrest and notify nearby app downloaders of the emergency to help provide first aid.
---

## ✨ HeartNet’s Goal
Target 3.4

By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being

Indicator 3.4.1
Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes
or chronic respiratory disease

1. Our AI model predicts cardiac arrest before it starts, increasing first aid time by more than 2 minutes.
2. Communicate this to nearby savers, paramedics, and stored call lists to execute first aid for cardiac arrest
3. Triple the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, with a goal of 25% survival, close to the 35% survival rate of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients.

## ✨ HeartNet’s solutions
Heartnet receives your health information through the Google Health Connect API.

It feeds this into an AI model that predicts cardiac arrest in advance. The model has achieved a very high predictive power.

This notifies Saver, including nearby app downloaders, to provide first aid, including quick CPR and AED.

We also use google maps to communicate nearby AEDs and hospitals to increase the chances of rescue.
